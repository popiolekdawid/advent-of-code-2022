# avent-of-code-2022
This are the programs I made for this years Avent of Code.

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. 
It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. 

For my programming language I choose JavaScript, but some of the stuff might be written in Python, idk yet.
